            Where I came from? Isn't really rational enough at least with me because I'm sure no one knows where God is, anyway, it were a dramatic life i started to live as an infant, it was great father middle upper class mother lower class at Krugersdorp North, fast-forward time unfortunately GBV caused her to divorce and take me to custody at 3.
            
            Got consciously aware of my life then,sadly at the rurals(Tlokweng) sadly because we were bred with no educational resources and motive so fast-forward time to end of 2015 i deeply thought of my future and I alone had had practice mathematics only, 6 months of 2016 results came favorably also the study/practice transcended and became good in almost all subjects i were taught...

            The year 2017/18 marked end of low level schooling, had passed academically meritorious with average of 75% it is sane with me although I had wanted to reach for the moon. University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg accepted me

            Keep moving forward; I told myself. Although I owe Wits ~ZAR86K in reflex I'm currently working minimum wage as purified water preparer...I plan to smart-save to unlimited heights of money, be it with gambling <a href="betway.com"> betway</a> ,foreign exchange trading, freelancing for websites development which is aligned with what i had planned to graduate in...in the meantime I've embarked on mindfulness and meditation JUST SO I COULD HEAL FROM SUM TYPA TRAUMA I HAVE BEEN GROWN AND BRED INTO. Honestly healing is just what I wanna attain so hard. Why? Answer lies in the past life experiences I have in memory...cognizantly looked deep in it I found a pattern that FAITH and RESPECTIVE ACTION really shine on reality

        <h2> Drugs and impact</h2>
        <p> Firstly, drugs I've or use in respective pattern, were Marijuana first time living at boding house grade 9 with no firm reason for doing but experimenting and even now I do. Then fast-forward time spacetime during those days of my deepest depression and anxiety back at end of April 2022 I did CAT,I remember those days I used to contemplate suicide (for the third time) so I were like "let me experience the drugs I never did before before I erase myself from the world". Same year I also consumed psychedelic mushrooms. I am still the same.
